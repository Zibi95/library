The project "Library" is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It is a web application that allows users to manage and organize their book collection. The HTML structure provides the foundation for displaying the book information, while CSS is used to style and enhance the visual presentation of the library interface. Vanilla JavaScript handles the logic of adding, editing, and removing books, as well as storing and retrieving data locally. Users can add new books by filling out a form, view their collection, mark books as read, and update the status of each book. This project showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and user-friendly library management system.
